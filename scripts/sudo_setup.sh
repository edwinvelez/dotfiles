# sudo_setup.sh - Arch Linux Post-Installation Setup Script
#
# This script is intended to be run on a minimal Arch Linux installation
# immediately after using the 'archinstall' script. It automates the
# installation and configuration of essential packages, drivers, a desktop
# environment, and user-specific settings.
#

# --- Sudo Check ---
# The script must be run as root. This block checks for root privileges
# and re-executes the script with 'sudo' if necessary, preserving the
# original user's environment variables (like SUDO_USER).
if [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then
   echo "This script requires root privileges. Re-running with sudo..."
   sudo --preserve-env "$0" "$@"
   exit
fi

# --- Script Safety ---
# These options make the script more robust and prevent unexpected behavior.
#   -e: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
#   -u: Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
#   -o pipefail: The return value of a pipeline is the status of the last
#                command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if no
#                command exited with a non-zero status.
set -e
set -u
set -o pipefail

# --- User Configuration ---
# Determines the non-root user who ran 'sudo'. This is critical for
# configuring the correct user account without hardcoding a username.
